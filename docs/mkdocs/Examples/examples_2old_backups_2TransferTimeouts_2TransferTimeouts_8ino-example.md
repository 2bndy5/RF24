This example demonstrates the use of and extended timeout period and auto-retries/auto-reUse to increase reliability in noisy or low signal scenarios.

Write this sketch to two different nodes. Put one of the nodes into 'transmit' mode by connecting with the serial monitor and sending a 'T'. The data 

 transfer will begin, with the receiver displaying the payload count and the data transfer rate.
