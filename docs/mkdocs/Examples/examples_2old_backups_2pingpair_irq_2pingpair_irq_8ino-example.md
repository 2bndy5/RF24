# examples/old_backups/pingpair_irq/pingpair_irq.ino


Updated by [TMRh20](https://github.com/TMRh20)

This is an example of how to user interrupts to interact with the radio, and a demonstration of how to use them to sleep when receiving, and not miss any payloads.

 The pingpair_sleepy example expands on sleep functionality with a timed sleep option for the transmitter. Sleep functionality is built directly into my fork of the RF24Network library


```cpp
```
