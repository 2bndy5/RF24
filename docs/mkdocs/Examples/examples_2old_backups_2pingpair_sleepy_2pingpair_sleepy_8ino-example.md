Updated by [TMRh20](https://github.com/TMRh20)

This is an example of how to use the [RF24](/Classes/classRF24/) class to create a battery- efficient system. It is just like the GettingStarted_CallResponse example, but the

 ping node powers down the radio and sleeps the MCU after every ping/pong cycle, and the receiver sleeps between payloads. 


```cpp
```
